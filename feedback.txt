Both lab partners making changes/commits (Lab 1.2) (30/30 pts)

Remarks. Very good work, Chloe and Seth.

I saw evidence of both of you committing changes to the repo.

There were extra files in your lab .ssh folder, or one level above this (-2.5 pts). Generally throughout semester, try not to leave unnecessary files hanging around.
